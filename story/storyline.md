# Story

*[Child version]*  
*(Adult version)*

The wind whistles through the trees, creepy crawlies scurry around the undergrowth, a wolf howls in the distance.  
Under the full moon, in the depths of the forest, a human-like creature looks around. Not sure of how it got here, not sure where 'here' even is!  
It knows its hands are cold, in fact everything is cold, down to its blood and bones. It knows one more thing, its name...

{name} hunched down. Staring into a murky puddle, their reflection can just about be seen...

A *BLUE Riband* chocolate bar fell out of their pocket. Overcome with hunger, they tried to eat it...but it did nothing for them. {name} wanted something different, something new...something...human! BRAINS!  
{name} stumbled forward as they realised what they had become, they were... A zombie!  
With this daunting realisation, {name} set off in search of some succulent grey matter to feed on...  

- CHOOSE RIGHT OR LEFT
- RIGHT  
  {name} ambled through the forest, their feet heavy and clumsy. They stepped heavily on a branch, breaking it with a loud CRACK. (The splintered stake plunged through {name}'s soft flesh with a squelch. Undeterred, they continued.) As the edge of the forest grew nearer, a large, industrial building loomed ahead. {name} approached, a tattered sign read "CI Chemical Laboratory". The remnants of an orange circular logo glimmered in the moonlight.  

  {name} clambered over some old barrels toward a slightly open door. Thick brambles propping it open, they pried it open with a loud creak. Inside, down a dark and eery corridor, {name} came to a dimly lit room. Rotten pumpkins sat in the corner, rats nibbling at the remains. On a table in the middle of the room, there stood three pristine glass flasks...

  - DRINK OR COLLECT?
  *Add clues throughout story to show which drink to collect. Riddle or hidden letters? BLUE riband chocolate bar?*
  - DRINK  
    {name} groaned as they lurched toward the table. The rats in the corner scuttled away into the cracks in the walls. A bright purple liquid glowed in the first flask; a deep, blood-red broth sat bubbling in the second; and a shimmering blue goo gurgled in the third. *As* {name} reached forward *, the chocolate bar wrapper fell from their pocket as they* tentatively selecting*ed* a drink...

    - RED  
      {name} lifted the bubbling broth to their lips. (If their sense of smell still worked, they would have been overcome with a putrid odour of stale blood, sulphur and a hint of petrol.) Hoping for the best, {name} poured the mixture down their throat. [It gurgled as it reached their stomach. {name} was overcome with drowsiness, their eyes grew heavy and they slumped to the floor...??GAME OVER??] ({name} wretched as the liquid bubbled ferociously, their insides burned. It was a mistake. Their stomach churned, heat exploded within them, and then... BANG. {name}'s gooey insides exploded all over the room...??GAME OVER??)

    - PURPLE  
      {name} raised the glowing liquid, gazing at its beautiful colour. Closing their eyes, {name} tilted their head back and downed the strange concoction in one large gulp. A warmth flooded through them. {name} heard a clattering from the next room and crept over to investigate. Inside, sweeping with an old tattered broom, a witch looked back at {name}. Overcome with adoration, they staggered forward. The witch announced her name, Jinx. {name} fell deeply in love with Jinx immediately, as the wicked witch enticed them over to a cage in the corner. She ushered {name} inside, locked the door and that was the last time {name} was ever seen...??GAME OVER??

    - BLUE  
      {name} slowly picked up the gleaming blue brew. Their hand trembled as they brought it to their mouth. Slowly, {name} began to sip from the flask. A cool sensation flowed down their throat, into their belly and beyond. Followed by a tingling and warmth. The hunger began to fade, their hands felt human again...{name} was cured! (YAY) [Pain seared from their foot, but the pain was welcomed...{name} knew they were human once again!]

  - COLLECT  
    {name} groaned as they lurched toward the table. The rats in the corner scuttled away into the cracks in the walls. A bright purple liquid glowed in the first flask; a deep, blood-red broth sat bubbling in the second; and a shimmering blue goo gurgled in the third. {name} reached forward to collect a concoction and continue on their quest...

    - RED
    - PURPLE
    - BLUE
      - *Save as variable?*

    {name} headed back toward the entrance of the laboratory. They stowed the flask inside a pocket of their jacket for safe keeping. (A little tight against their body, they heard a rib crack under the extra pressure.) {name} trudged slowly back into the forest, coming back to where they began their journey.

- LEFT  
  Lumbering on through the tall trees, {name} felt a chill as they approached a clearing. Stood in the middle, 10ft tall, a snowman leered toward {name}.  
  "Mmmrrroohahg" it groaned, "Mmmm I am Brian....zombie o'greedy!"  
  As the snowman murmered an introduction, {name} could see this was no ordinary snowman. (Beneath a dark pair of sunglasses, glowing red eyes could be seen. Green goo oozed from its neck, one stick of an arm was broken half way. The top of his head had melted away, exposing a pulsating mass of blue gunk - was that a brain?) This was a zombie snowman! Should {name} try and feed on this creatures brains...

  - FEED OR DON'T FEED
  - FEED  
    Stood on the edge of the clearing, {name} beckoned the snowman over to them.
    Brian rolled forward toward. Its lower body section seemingly separate, like a wheel, allowing him to stay upright. As he slowed to a stop, {name} clambered up the nearest tree. Crawling along a branch, when Brian stood just below, {name} dropped onto his head. As {name} tried to take a bite into the snowman's head, they were very glad their sense of taste had failed. Brian roared in anger! [He flung {name} to the ground and rolled on top of them.  
    "For your crime against me, you will remain under me, forever!" Brian bellowed...  
    {name} was never seen again ??GAME OVER??] (He flung {name} to the ground, leaning over them, green goo dripping on top of {name}'s head. Brian grinned an evil grin,  
    "I am Brian, zombie O'Greedy! I will not be eaten by a puny human zombie...I will feast upon you!" he roared. And with that, he ripped poor {name} limb from limb as he devoured their soft, fleshy carcass. ??GAME OVER??)

  - DON'T FEED  
    Using what is left of their logic, {name} decides it best not to take on a 10ft snowman zombie and greets Brian instead.  
    "Hello, I am {name}," {name} calls out, "I mean you no harm, can you help me?"  
    An eery howl can be heard in the distance. Brian trundles toward {name},  
    "You look pale," Brian groans, "You must be one of Toby's creeps...he is the king of all zombies!! I hear he is looking for the cure, perhaps you can help him"  
    The giant snowman waves an arm vaguely to the south, "Head that way, you will find him soon enough."

  - HEAD TO ZOMBIE KING OR NOT
  - TO ZOMBIE KING
    {name} heads toward the south. The trees seem to be more twisted now. An owl sits up high, hooting. A dull and rhythmic thudding gets louder as {name} stomps toward a cave. The glow of a firey torch illuminates the cave entrance. A horde of zombies march mindlessly in circles. A couple sit off to one side, boiling something in a pan. (Another is using its own bloody finger to paint on the cave wall).  
    "Welcome, {name}, I am Toby...King of the Zombies!" a loud and powerful voice echoes, "I am fed up with these imbeciles, look at those two trying to make rice! What good is that to our kind...especially when it is so burnt!"  
    {name} sees a grand looking figure gesturing to the couple by the cave entrance. His eyes are piercing ice white, his stocky frame looks less squidgy than the other zombies. A regal necklace surrounds his collar and a jewelled crown sits atop his head. Truly, he is the King. {name} groans as they walk toward this mighty zombie.  
    "How did you know my name?" {name} asks with a quivering, croaky voice.  
    "I know all zombies!" Toby replies, "Now...are you here to help me!?"...

    - HELP ZOMBIE KING OR NOT
    - HELP
      "I will help you," sounding more confident than anticipated, "Brian said you are searching for a cure?"  
      "Yes, I heard of a witch who made us this way," Toby glared menacingly out toward the dark night, "She wouldn't be so foolish to infect us all without a backup plan. Have you found any potions on your travels?"...

      - HAVE CHEMICALS?
      - YES  
        {name} reached inside their jacket, pulling out the flask from the laboratory.  
        "Yes," they announced, "Are you sure it is the cure?"  
        Toby laughed, a deep and wholesome laugh,  
        "Well, it is you that will take the first drink, so what are you waiting for?" Toby looked on in suspense, waiting for {name} to drink from the flask.

        - COLOUR?
          - BLUE  
            Knowing there is no other choice, no way to avoid this fate, {name} raises the flask to their lips, closes their eyes and swigs a mouthful. A cool sensation flowed down their throat, into their belly and beyond. Followed by a tingling and warmth. The hunger began to fade, their hands felt human again...{name} was cured! They passed the drink to Toby and waited for him to drink to his health. The warm blood rushed to his cheeks as he shared the cure around the others. {name} and Toby left the cave, clear headed and focussed, they found their way back to civilisation, back to humanity. (YAY)

          - RED
            Knowing there is no other choice, no way to avoid this fate, {name} lifted the bubbling broth to their lips. (If their sense of smell still worked, they would have been overcome with a putrid odour of stale blood, sulphur and a hint of petrol.) Hoping for the best, {name} poured the mixture down their throat. [It gurgled as it reached their stomach. {name} was overcome with drowsiness, their eyes grew heavy and they slumped to the floor...??GAME OVER??] ({name} wretched as the liquid bubbled ferociously, their insides burned. It was a mistake. Their stomach churned, heat exploded within them, and then... BANG. {name}'s gooey insides exploded all over the cave...??GAME OVER??)

          - PURPLE  
            Knowing there is no other choice, no way to avoid this fate, {name} raised the glowing liquid, gazing at its beautiful colour. Closing their eyes, {name} tilted their head back and downed the strange concoction in one large gulp. A warmth flooded through them. They drank the entire potion. Toby cried out in anger...but {name} didn't care. Toby was perfect to them, in every way. They sat down next to Toby and told him everything would be OK, they had each other...and love was all that mattered. *That and the Porter's X2 RayGun that lay in the corner...* The torch light eventually dimmed, the sound of zombies stomping around and around finally silenced and {name} was never seen again. (YAY??)

      - NO  
        {name} shuffled their feet awkwardly, looking down at the floor.  
        "I have not, I will go back through the forest and find this cure for us both"  they declared and headed off back to where they began. RIGHT

        - DRINK OR COLLECT?
        - DRINK  
          Same as RIGHT
        - COLLECT
          **Replace** *coming back to where they began their journey.* **with** finally making their way back to Toby and his horde.

    - DON'T HELP
        Not knowing what this could lead to, {name} tried to decline. As they turned to leave the cave, Toby called upon his zombie followers,  
        "Don't let {name} leave. For this act against us all, we shall get our revenge." He pointed to the back of the cave. (The zombies stopped their circles and picked {name} up, carrying them to the back of the cave, never to be seen again...??GAME OVER??) [A bath tub sat over a fire, brown liquid frothing inside. "To the coffee bath!"  
        The zombies stopped their circles and grabbed hole of {name}, carrying them to the bath. They threw them in and jeered and groaned as {name}'s mushy body melted in the hot coffee pot.]
  
  - REFUSE
    {name} didn't like the sound of a zombie king. They took their chances and turned to the trees and walked on...and on...and on...(Never to be seen again. ??GAME OVER??) [It seemed they were approaching the edge of the forest when a howl rang through their ears. A huge wolf reared up on its hind legs, came down on {name}'s chest with a mighty strength and sank its teeth into their fleshy body. Now a new threat to the world was born...A Zombie Werewolf!??DUN DUN DUNNN!!!!??]
