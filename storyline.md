*[Child version]*  
*(Adult version)*

The wind whistles through the trees, creepy crawlies scurry around the undergrowth, a wolf howls in the distance.  
Under the full moon, in the depths of the forest, a human-like creature looks around. Not sure of how it got here, not sure where 'here' even is!  
It knows its hands are cold, in fact everything is cold, down to its blood and bones. It knows one more thing, its name...

{name} hunched down. Staring into a murky puddle, their reflection can just about be seen...

A chocolate bar fell out of their pocket. Overcome with hunger, they tried to eat it...but it did nothing for them. {name} wanted something different, something new...something...human! BRAINS!  
{name} stumbled forward as they realised what they had become, they were... A zombie!  
With this daunting realisation, {name} set off in search of some succulent grey matter to feed on...

  - RIGHT  
    {name} ambled through the forest, their feet heavy and clumsy. They stepped heavily on a branch, breaking it with a loud CRACK. (The splintered stake plunged through {name}'s soft flesh with a squelch. Undeterred, they continued.) As the edge of the forest grew nearer, a large, industrial building loomed ahead. {name} approached, a tattered sign read "CI Chemical Laboratory". The remnants of an orange circular logo glimmered in the moonlight.  

    {name} clambered over some old barrels toward a slightly open door. Thick brambles propping it open, they pried it open with a loud creak. Inside, down a dark and eery corridor, {name} came to a dimly lit room. Rotten pumpkins sat in the corner, rats nibbling at the remains. On a table in the middle of the room, there stood three pristine glass flasks...

    - DRINK OR COLLECT?
      - DRINK  
        {name} groaned as they lurched toward the table. The rats in the corner scuttled away into the cracks in the walls. A bright purple liquid glowed in the first flask; a deep, blood-red broth sat bubbling in the second; and a shimmering blue goo gurgled in the third. {name} reached forward, tentatively selecting a drink...

        - RED  
          {name} lifted the bubbling broth to their lips. (If their sense of smell still worked, they would have been overcome with a putrid odour of stale blood, sulphur and a hint of petrol.) Hoping for the best, {name} poured the mixture down their throat. [It gurgled as it reached their stomach. {name} was overcome with drowsiness, their eyes grew heavy and they slumped to the floor...??GAME OVER??] ({name} wretched as the liquid bubbled ferociously, their insides burned. It was a mistake. Their stomach churned, heat exploded within them, and then... BANG. {name}'s gooey insides exploded all over the room...??GAME OVER??)

        - PURPLE  
          {name} raised the glowing liquid, gazing at its beautiful colour. Closing their eyes, {name} tilted their head back and downed the strange concoction in one large gulp. A warmth flooded through them. {name} heard a clattering from the next room and crept over to investigate. Inside, sweeping with an old tattered broom, a witch looked back at {name}. Overcome with adoration, they staggered forward. The witch announced her name, Jinx. {name} fell deeply in love with Jinx immediately, as the wicked witch enticed them over to a cage in the corner. She ushered {name} inside, locked the door and that was the last time {name} was ever seen...??GAME OVER??

        - BLUE  
          {name} slowly picked up the gleaming blue brew. Their hand trembled as they brought it to their mouth. Slowly, {name} began to sip from the flask. A cool sensation flowed down their throat, into their belly and beyond. Followed by a tingling and warmth. The hunger began to fade, their hands felt human again...{name} was cured! (YAY) [Pain seared from their foot, but the pain was welcomed...{name} knew they were human once again!]

      - COLLECT  
        {name} groaned as they lurched toward the table. The rats in the corner scuttled away into the cracks in the walls. A bright purple liquid glowed in the first flask; a deep, blood-red broth sat bubbling in the second; and a shimmering blue goo gurgled in the third. {name} reached forward to collect a concoction and continue on their quest...

        - RED
        - PURPLE
        - BLUE
          - *Save as variable?*

        {name} headed back toward the entrance of the laboratory. They stowed the flask inside a pocket of their jacket for safe keeping. (A little tight against their body, they heard a rib crack under the extra pressure.) {name} trudged slowly back into the forest, coming back to where they began their journey.

  - LEFT  

Lumbering on through the tall trees, {name} felt a chill as they approached a clearing. Stood in the middle, 10ft tall, a snowman leered toward {name}.  
"Mmmrrroohahg" it groaned, "Mmmm I am Brian....zombie o'greedy!"  
As the snowman murmered an introduction, {name} could see this was no ordinary snowman. (Beneath a dark pair of sunglasses, glowing red eyes could be seen. Green goo oozed from its neck, one stick of an arm was broken half way. The top of his head had melted away, exposing a pulsating mass of blue gunk - was that a brain?) This was a zombie snowman! Should {name} try and feed on this creatures brains...

  - FEED  
    Stood on the edge of the clearing, {name} beckoned the snowman over to them.
    Brian rolled forward toward. Its lower body section seemingly separate, like a wheel, allowing him to stay upright. As he slowed to a stop, {name} clambered up the nearest tree. Crawling along a branch, when Brian stood just below, {name} dropped onto his head. As {name} tried to take a bite into the snowman's head, Brian roared in anger! [He flung {name} to the ground and rolled on top of them.  
    "For your crime against me, you will remain under me, forever!" Brian bellowed...  
    {name} was never seen again ??GAME OVER??] (He flung {name} to the ground, leaning over them, green goo dripping on top of {name}'s head. Brian grinned an evil grin,  
    "I am Brian, zombie O'Greedy! I will not be eaten by a puny human zombie...I will feast upon you!" he roared. And with that, he ripped poor {name} limb from limb as he devoured their soft, fleshy carcass. ??GAME OVER??)
  - DON'T FEED
USER SAYS YES
{name} grabbed the snowman and began tearing into its head. {name} was thankful that they couldn’t taste it, the texture was bad enough! But wait, something was wrong. {name} tried to think. Why wasn’t this right?
CLICK
Of course! {name} felt so stupid. Snowmen don’t have brains. {name} looked down at the snowman, let go of the snowman’s head, and tried to speak. ‘Mmmmmrrrrrrsssssrrrrrr’ {name} groaned. The snowman looked scared, but took it’s chance at freedom and wobbled off.
USER SAYS NO
{name} waved hello to the snowman, in the way that only a zombie can wave - slowly. {name} remembered that it only knew how to do one thing - look for human brains. And that it had enough of them to last it until the next day. But once, {name} had known more than brains.
Then made a noise that the frost creatures had learned to understand. {name} waited. Seconds seemed like hours, but must be minutes, as they waited they began to get faster, until they jumped when--
Nothing happened. Why couldn’t {name} remember things? Surely they remembered names? I bet they did. Maybe this thing wasn’t so alone after all. Our zombie was
Don’t look back. Don’t look!
It was overwhelming. It was horrible. ‘Crrrrraaaash!’ And suddenly it was 2009, and we were in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. An infected human tore into the back of our leg, and rammed the bone deep into our flesh. We dropped to our knees. Another went into our arm. We groaned, and a human head smashed through our eye
