# Story

*[Child version]*  
*(Adult version)*

The wind whistles through the trees, creepy crawlies scurry around the undergrowth, a wolf howls in the distance.  
Under the full moon, in the depths of the forest, a human like creature looks around. Not sure of how it got here, not sure where 'here' even is!  
It knows its hands are cold, in fact everything is cold, down to its blood and bones. I knows one more thing, its name...

- USER ENTERS NAME

{name} hunched down. A chocolate bar fell out of their pocket. Overcome with  
hunger, they tried to eat it...but it did nothing for them. {name} wanted  
something different, something new...something...human! BRAINS! {name} stumbled  
forward as they realised what they had become, they were...  
A zombie!  
With this daunting realisation, {name} set off in search of some succulent grey matter to feed on...  

- CHOOSE RIGHT OR LEFT
  - RIGHT  
    {name} ambled through the forest, their feet heavy and clumsy. They stepped  
    heavily on a branch, breaking it with a loud CRACK. (The splintered stake  
    plunged through {name}'s soft flesh with a squelch. Undeterred, they  
    continued.) As the edge of the forest grew nearer, a large, industrial  
    building loomed ahead. {name} approached, a tattered sign read "CI Chemical  
    Laboratory". The remnance of an orange circular logo glimmered in the  
    moonlight.  

    {name} clambered over some old barrels toward a slightly open door. Thick brambles propping it open, they pried it open with a loud creak. Inside, down a dark and eery corridor, {name} came to a dimly lit room. Rotten pumpkins sat in the corner, rats nibbling at the remains. On a table in the middle of the room there were three pristeen glass flasks...

    - DRINK OR COLLECT?
      - DRINK  
        {name} groaned as they lurched toward the table. The rats in the corner  
        scuttled away into the cracks in the walls. A bright purple liquid  
        glowed in the first flask; a deep, blood red broth sat bubbling in the  
        second; and a shimmering blue goo gurgled in the third. {name} reached  
        forward, tentatively selecting a drink...

        - RED  
          {name} lifted the bubbling broth to their lips. (If their sense of  
          smell still worked, they would have been overcome with a putrid odour  
          of stale blood, sulphur and a hint of petrol.) Hoping for the best,  
          {name} poured the mixture down their throat. [It gurgled as it reached  
          their stomach. {name} was overcome with drowziness, their eyes grew  
          heavy and they slumped to the floor...??GAME OVER??] ({name} wretched  
          as the liquid bubbled ferociously, their insides burned. It was a  
          mistake. Their stomach churned, heat exploded within them, and then...  
          BANG. {name}'s gooey insides exploded all over the room...??GAME OVER??)

        - PURPLE  
          {name} raised the glowing liquid, gazing at its beautiful colour.  
          Closing their eyes, {name} tilted their head back and downed the  
          strange concoction in one large gulp. A warmth flooded through them.  
          {name} heard a clattering from the next room and crept over to  
          investigate. Inside, sweeping with an old tattered broom, a witch  
          looked back at {name}. Overcome with adoration, they staggered  
          forward. The witch announced her name, Jinx. {name} fell deeply in  
          love with Jinx immediately, as the wicked witch enticed them over to  
          a cage in the corner. She ushered {name} inside, locked the door and  
          that was the last time {name} was ever seen...??GAME OVER??

        - BLUE  
          {name} slowly picked up the gleaming blue brew. Their hand trembled as  
          they brought it to their mouth. Slowly, {name} began to sip from the  
          flask. A cool sensation flowed down their throat, into their belly and  
          beyond. Followed by a tingling and warmth. The hunger began to fade,  
          their hands felt human again...{name} was cured! (YAY) [Pain seered  
          from their foot, but the pain was welcomed...{name} knew they were  
          human once again!]

{name} saw a snowman in the street ahead - perfect - brains! But should {name} submit to their urges to eat the snowman’s brain?
USER SAYS YES
{name} grabbed the snowman and began tearing into its head. {name} was thankful that they couldn’t taste it, the texture was bad enough! But wait, something was wrong. {name} tried to think. Why wasn’t this right?
CLICK
Of course! {name} felt so stupid. Snowmen don’t have brains. {name} looked down at the snowman, let go of the snowman’s head, and tried to speak. ‘Mmmmmrrrrrrsssssrrrrrr’ {name} groaned. The snowman looked scared, but took it’s chance at freedom and wobbled off.
USER SAYS NO
{name} waved hello to the snowman, in the way that only a zombie can wave - slowly. {name} remembered that it only knew how to do one thing - look for human brains. And that it had enough of them to last it until the next day. But once, {name} had known more than brains.
Then made a noise that the frost creatures had learned to understand. {name} waited. Seconds seemed like hours, but must be minutes, as they waited they began to get faster, until they jumped when--
Nothing happened. Why couldn’t {name} remember things? Surely they remembered names? I bet they did. Maybe this thing wasn’t so alone after all. Our zombie was
Don’t look back. Don’t look!
It was overwhelming. It was horrible. ‘Crrrrraaaash!’ And suddenly it was 2009, and we were in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. An infected human tore into the back of our leg, and rammed the bone deep into our flesh. We dropped to our knees. Another went into our arm. We groaned, and a human head smashed through our eye
