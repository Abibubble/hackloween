On every device and browser listed above, I tested the following:

## Links and Navigation

---

## Styling and Layout

## Functions

### Modals

* The Age Control modal is visible in front of all other items on the screen, and clearly displays the Cancel and Delete buttons.
* The Brian modal is visible in front of all other items on the screen, and clearly displays the Cancel and Delete buttons.

### Homepage

* The main story is displayed on this page.
* The user's choices changes the page depending on what choice they've made.

### 404

* Accessible by all users
* This page will display if a user has tried to access a page that doesn't exist, or if a user doesn't have access to the page they're trying to reach.
* It accesses whether the user is logged in or not, and if logged in, what admin rights they have, and displays the corresponding navigation bar.
* It states clearly that it's a 404 error, and that the page hasn't been found.
* It directs the user to the navigation bar to continue back to the safety of the site.
