## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

This project was created for the Code Institute Halloween Hackathon in October 2021. The theme for this was 'Spookathon'. We were tasked with creating an interactive Halloween book or story. The brief stated that this project needs to depict a halloween story or fairy tale, it needs to be able to be interacted with in some way, and it should have animated elements. It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through. We wanted this site to be accessible to users of all ages, and we wanted to be fully inclusive of gender choices.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

* To depict a Halloween story or fairy tale.
* To be able to be interacted with in some way.
* To have animated elements.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* Easy to understand what to do.
* Easy to navigate.
* Easy to follow storyline.
* Accessible for people of all ages.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* Different endings to the story.
* Doesn't exclude people of any gender.

## Design

### Color Scheme

* The following colors have been used:
  * Dark orange - #fe5404
  * Light orange - #ff8c00
  * Dark purple transparent - #6600ff55
  * Dark purple - #3e2a57
  * Yellow - #ffc106
  * Dark grey - #272727
  * Light grey - #faebd7
  * Black - #000000
  * White - #ffffff
* These colors have all been chosen to match the spooky, Halloween theme of this site.

### Typography

* The main fonts used are [Neucha](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Neucha?query=Neucha) and [Finger Paint](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Finger+Paint?query=finger+paint) from Google Fonts.
* These fonts have been used to link the story aspect with the Halloween theme.
* They are rough fonts, similar to clumpy handwriting, which match the zombie theme nicely.

### Imagery

* The background image is of a spooky forest at night, which sets the Halloween theming.
* The modal background image is of some carved pumpkins, to link with the Halloween theme.
* The characters are all zombies, to fit with the storyline.
* The image in the progress bar is a dismembered hand, to fill the entire site with spooky theming.
* The images at the end of the progress bar change depending on which ending the user gets.
* There are two black pumpkins in the top corners of the header, to link with the Halloween theme.

### Wireframes

The design for this site changed as we realised what was a realistic end product. These are the original wireframes:

* [Original wireframes for desktop for this project](assets/docs/wireframes-desktop.png).
* [Original wireframes for mobile for this project](assets/docs/wireframes-mobile.png).

Once we had changed the designs for the site, we re-made the wireframes for our new design ideas:

* [Wireframes after design change](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf).

### Features

* A progress bar to track the user's progress through the story.
* An animated page-turn.
* Animated character avatars.
* Story change depending on the age preference chosen.
* Multiple story endings.
* Background audio that changes depending on the section of story that the user is on.
* Sound effects that play when the user is reading the relevant page.

### Future Features

* Full sound effects linked to each page.
* Randomised spider animation for going up and down its web.
* Capital letter at the start of a sentence where the user's pronoun starts the sentence.
* Different ending page for each type of game over.

### Audio

* The following audio is used to set the scene at various parts of the story:
  * Bubbles audio for the bubbling potion.
  * Drinking audio for if the user chooses to drink the potion.
  * Large zombie horde.
  * Small zombie horde.
  * Splash audio for when the user looks into the puddle.
  * Windy trees audio to set the scene at the start of the story.
  * Zombie biting audio if the user chooses to feed from Brian.
  * Zombie hiss audio for zombie attacks.
  * Zombie moan audio for when zombies speak.
  * Page turning audio for when the user turns the page.
  * Child giggling audio for the child-friendly choice.
* Two different background audios have been used:
  * Gentle eerie audio, for the majority of the story.
  * Dramatic music for when the zombie horde arrives.
