## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

This project was created for the Code Institute Halloween Hackathon in October 2021. The theme for this was 'Spookathon'. We were tasked with creating an interactive Halloween book or story. The brief stated that this project needs to depict a halloween story or fairy tale, it needs to be able to be interacted with in some way, and it should have animated elements. It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through. We wanted this site to be accessible to users of all ages, and we wanted to be fully inclusive of gender choices.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

* To depict a Halloween story or fairy tale.
* To be able to be interacted with in some way.
* To have animated elements.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* Easy to understand what to do.
* Easy to navigate.
* Easy to follow storyline.
* Accessible for people of all ages.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* Different endings to the story.
* Doesn't exclude people of any gender.

## Design

### Color Scheme

* The following colors have been used:
  * Dark orange - #fe5404
  * Light orange - #ff8c00
  * Dark purple transparent - #6600ff55
  * Dark purple - #3e2a57
  * Yellow - #ffc106
  * Dark grey - #272727
  * Light grey - #faebd7
  * Black - #000000
  * White - #ffffff
* These colors have all been chosen to match the spooky, Halloween theme of this site.

### Typography

* The main fonts used are [Neucha](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Neucha?query=Neucha) and [Finger Paint](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Finger+Paint?query=finger+paint) from Google Fonts.
* These fonts have been used to link the story aspect with the Halloween theme.
* They are rough fonts, similar to clumpy handwriting, which match the zombie theme nicely.

### Imagery

* The background image is of a spooky forest at night, which sets the Halloween theming.
* The modal background image is of some carved pumpkins, to link with the Halloween theme.
* The characters are all zombies, to fit with the storyline.
* The image in the progress bar is a dismembered hand, to fill the entire site with spooky theming.
* The images at the end of the progress bar change depending on which ending the user gets.
* There are two black pumpkins in the top corners of the header, to link with the Halloween theme.

### Wireframes

The design for this site changed as we realised what was a realistic end product. These are the original wireframes:

* [Original wireframes for desktop for this project](assets/docs/wireframes-desktop.png).
* [Original wireframes for mobile for this project](assets/docs/wireframes-mobile.png).

Once we had changed the designs for the site, we re-made the wireframes for our new design ideas:

* [Wireframes after design change](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf).

### Features

* A progress bar to track the user's progress through the story.
* An animated page-turn.
* Animated character avatars.
* Story change depending on the age preference chosen.
* Multiple story endings.
* Background audio that changes depending on the section of story that the user is on.
* Sound effects that play when the user is reading the relevant page.

### Future Features

* A different image for every paragraph, depicting what's happening in the story.
* Full sound effects linked to each page.
* Randomised spider animation for going up and down its web.

### Audio

* The following audio is used to set the scene at various parts of the story:
  * Bubbles audio for the bubbling potion.
  * Drinking audio for if the user chooses to drink the potion.
  * Large zombie horde.
  * Small zombie horde.
  * Splash audio for when the user looks into the puddle.
  * Windy trees audio to set the scene at the start of the story.
  * Zombie biting audio if the user chooses to feed from Brian.
  * Zombie hiss audio for zombie attacks.
  * Zombie moan audio for when zombies speak.
  * Page turning audio for when the user turns the page.
  * Child giggling audio for the child-friendly choice.
* Two different background audios have been used:
  * Gentle eerie audio, for the majority of the story.
  * Dramatic music for when the zombie horde arrives.

### Solved Bugs

1. [The responsive pumpkin border](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnODfFJTLGg) caused us issues on all browsers except for Google Chrome.
    * We checked on [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) and didn't see any issues with the border-image property not being supported.
    * We tried prefixing the border-image properties with `-webkit-` and `-moz` but that didn't help.
    * In the end, we removed the border, and instead used the pumpkin images as accents on the header.

### Known Bugs

* The pronoun updates aren't working for the age inserts currently.
* The characters walk off the screen after the user chooses a character, then reappear and are dragged off.
* The spider comes down the web, but doesn't go back up.

### Lighthouse

We tested our website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop Lighthouse

![Lighthouse desktop first try](assets/docs/lighthouse-desktop.png)

#### Mobile Lighthouse

![Lighthouse mobile first try](assets/docs/lighthouse-mobile.png)

#### Performance

* Unfortunately we weren't as happy with this score.
* We lost a lot of points here because the site is incredibly image-heavy.
* We have also used gifs for animated content, which Lighthouse usually recommends to display as videos.
* This wasn't an option for us, due to how we wanted to use the gifss.

#### Accessibility

* We were happy with this score.
* We ensured to include accessibility as a top priority whilst developing this site.

#### Best Practices

* We were happy with this score.
* The only thing causing us to lose points here was the severed hand gif, which we have rendered slightly squashed. However, this was a design choice, as we wanted the hand to look like it was being pressed in my the top and bottom of the progress bar.

#### SEO

* We were happy with this score.
* We ensured to have all relevant meta tags in place for best SEO.
